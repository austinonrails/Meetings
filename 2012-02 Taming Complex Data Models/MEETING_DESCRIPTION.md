Beginner Talk: **Demystifying ActiveRecord** &mdash; Anthony Lewis

> For many new Rails developers, their first exposure to Rails (and often Ruby) is through ActiveRecord and "magical" incantations like 'has_many' or 'belongs_to'. In this talk, we'll pull back the curtain on ActiveRecord and see what's going on under the hood. We won't assume any prior knowledge of Rails or ActiveRecord, but may skim over explaining methods and parameters which are already well documented elsewhere. Instead, we'll focus on the "big picture", identifying the main concepts and components and explaining how they fit together.

**Anthony Lewis** is an Internal Tools Developer at [PeopleAdmin](http://www.peopleadmin.com). Prior to
that he was a freelance web developer and teacher.

Advanced Talk: **Taming Complex Data Models** &mdash; Mason Hale

> The real-world is rife with complex relationships and arbitrary rules. As developers, we are often faced with the challenge of modeling and managing these complexities in our applications. In this talk, we'll delve into some of the "hairier" complex data-modeling scenarios like hierarchies, N-way relationships, and aggregated data and explore some of the patterns and techniques to tame these wild beasts.

**Mason Hale** is the founder and CTO of TeamTopia, the company behind [SwimTopia](http://www.swimtopia.com), the world's friendliest swim team management solution.
