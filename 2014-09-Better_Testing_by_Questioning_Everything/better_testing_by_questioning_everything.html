# Better Testing By Questioning Everything

## Nathan Ladd

# What is Testing?

---

class: center, middle

Any time you exercise your code *without* intending to derive value from it's intended use, you are probably testing.

In fact, you have *always* been driving your development through tests.

---

"Nathan, you're being pedantic. We practice Test Driven Development when we drive our development through *automated* tests."

---

class: middle

Fine, but tests only benefit the design of our code if *all* forms of testing drive development. Besides automated regression tests, consider:

1. Automated monitoring
1. Feature acceptance
1. Configuration checking
1. Third party integrations
1. A/B tests

---

The requirements that all forms of testing impose on your software *do* lead to more modular, decoupled designs.

---

class: center, middle

However, that's not quite enough to ensure your software will remain inexpensive to maintain going forward.

There are some simple, straightforward approaches to writing automated tests that can increase the likelihood that you produce *maintinable* software.
---

class: center, middle

## First, start optimizing for reading your tests, not writing them

---

class: middle

### This is optimized for writing:

```ruby
describe Payment do
  let(:credit_card) { Fabricate(:credit_card) }
  let(:processor) { TestPaymentProcessor }
  let(:payment) { described_class.new(credit_card, amount, processor) }

  # ...

  context "the response" do
    let(:amount) { 19.95 }
    subject { payment.response }

    its(:status) { is_expected_to == :success }
    its(:amount_charged) { is_expected_to == amount }
  end
end
```

#### Can unit tests actually document code better than code does?

## A Unit Test, Revisited

---

class: middle

```ruby
class PaymentTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_charging_credit_cards
    credit_card = CreditCard.new(
      number: '4444333322221111',
      expiry: Date.new(2015, 11, 5),
    )

    payment = Payment.new credit_card, 19.95, TestPaymentProcessor
    response = payment.charge

    assert_equal :success, response.status
    assert_equal 19.95, response.amount_charged
  end
end
```

### Four questions we ask about code we are reading for the first time

1. What does this software do?
1. What does the software need me to supply in order to run?
1. How do I invoke the software?
1. Does it actually work?

---

class: middle

## Four answers that you can find in the test, if you know how to look for it

1. Explain
1. Setup
1. Execute
1. Assert

---

class: middle

```ruby
class PaymentTest < Minitest::Test
  # Explain
  def test_charging_credit_cards
    # Setup
:   credit_card = CreditCard.new(
      number: '4444333322221111',
      expiry: Date.new(2015, 11, 5),
    )

    # Execute
    payment = Payment.new credit_card, 19.95, TestPaymentProcessor
    response = payment.charge

    # Assert
    assert_equal :success, response.status
    assert_equal 19.95, response.amount_charged
  end
end
```

## Essential vs. Accidental Complexity

---

```ruby
class Payment
  def self.charge credit_card, amount
    instance = new credit_card, amount, PaypalGateway, Rails.logger
    instance.charge
  end

  attr :credit_card, :amount, :payment_processor, :logger

  def initialize credit_card, amount, payment_processor, logger = Logger.new('/dev/null')
    @credit_card = credit_card
    @amount = amount
    @payment_processor = payment_processor
    @logger = logger
  end

  def charge
    if payment_processor.charge credit_card, amount
      logger.info "Successfully charged for $#{amount}"
      PaymentResponse.new :success, amount
    else
      logger.info
      PaymentResponse.new :failed, 0
    end
  end
end
```
